# ðŸ’Ž Datamine Gems #GameFi: The Ultimate Real-Time Game

Datamine Gems #GameFi represents the ultimate fusion of gaming and finance, creating a real-time, decentralized, and highly engaging experience for users within the Datamine Network. It transforms the act of token burning and reward collection into an interactive game.

## The Game Concept

At its core, Datamine Gems is a game where players collect "gems." Each gem represents a public market address with an unminted balance of tokens. The goal is to be the fastest and most efficient at collecting these gems by burning tokens.

## Key Features and Mechanics

### Real-Time Interaction
The game operates in real-time, allowing users to monitor and interact with gems as their unminted values grow. This dynamic environment encourages quick decision-making and strategic play.

### Decentralized and Anonymous
Anyone, anywhere in the world, can play anonymously. The game is built on decentralized smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness without central control.

### Low Gas Fees & Mobile-Friendly
Designed for accessibility, Datamine Gems aims for low gas fees, making it affordable for a wide range of users. It is also mobile-friendly, allowing players to participate on the go.

### Version 2 Public Market Smart Contract
The game leverages a new Version 2 of our Public Market smart contract, which introduces several enhancements:
*   **Burning Before Reward Distribution:** New game theory concepts are introduced by burning tokens *before* reward distribution.
*   **Atomic Batch Burning:** Enables burning from multiple addresses in a single transaction, significantly increasing throughput.
*   **Automatic Minting to Latest Ethereum Block:** Ensures maximum rewards by minting to the most recent block.
*   **Automatic Amount Prefilling:** Optimizes reward collection by prefilling amounts for the highest returns.
*   **Optional Custom Burn Amount:** Users can specify custom burn amounts, even if it exceeds their unminted balance (e.g., burning 1000 tokens when 700 are unminted and 300 are in market balance).
*   **Optimized Rewards Distribution:** Further refinements to how rewards are distributed for efficiency.

### "Collect All Gems" Button
To maximize efficiency and user experience, a "Collect all gems" button has been introduced. This feature allows users to collect all visible gems on the screen in a single, atomic transaction, even from 10+ different addresses. This significantly increases transactional throughput and optimizes GameFi mechanics.

### Visual Representation
Datamine Gems presents gems as diamonds on the decentralized dashboard. The size and color of these diamonds change based on the unminted dollar amount they represent, making it easy to identify high-value opportunities. Users can customize gem colors.

### Validator Benefits
Validators who participate in Datamine Gems by enabling public market minting will receive greater rewards through more frequent burning to their addresses. This creates a symbiotic relationship between players and validators, driving monetary velocity within the ecosystem.

## How to Play

1.  **Monitor Gems:** Observe the growing unminted dollar amounts represented by the diamonds on the page.
2.  **Select Gems:** Choose individual gems or use the "Collect all gems" button.
3.  **Burn Tokens:** Execute a transaction to burn tokens to the selected public market addresses.
4.  **Collect Rewards:** Instantly receive minted tokens as rewards.

Datamine Gems is more than just a game; it's a strategic tool to increase monetary velocity, optimize minting efficiency, and further decentralize demand within the Datamine Network.
