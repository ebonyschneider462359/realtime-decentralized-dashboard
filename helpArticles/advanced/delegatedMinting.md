# How to Use Delegated Minting

Delegated minting allows you to designate a different Ethereum wallet address to mint your FLUX tokens. This is particularly useful for keeping your DAM tokens in cold storage while using a web-based wallet for minting.

You can delegate minting to any Ethereum address compatible with MetaMask. For instance, you could start a validator and grant a friend permission to mint your FLUX balance directly to their address.

## Step 1: Start Your Validator
Click "Start Validator" to begin the process.

## Step 2. 
At the next screen, enter the total DAM tokens you would like to start your validator with. Then select the following Minting Address option:

**"I want another address to mint FLUX on my behalf (Delegated Minter)"**

Be sure to enter the Ethereum address that will mint your FLUX (e.g. your friend's Ethereum address).

## Step 5. 
Go to the **Address Balances** section of your Dashboard. 
If you hover your mouse **over your address in the top right corner**, your address-specific dashboard URL will be displayed. Notice in the lower right-hand corner you can also see the Minter Address.

Here is a closer look at the **address-specific dashboard link (URL)**.

In order to mint FLUX using a Minter Address, it is important that you know your address-specific dashboard URL.
Visiting your dashboard-specific URL from a Minter Address MetaMask account will allow you to mint FLUX on behalf of your original mint address.

**In Summary:**
1) Datamine mint can be started inside "address A" while "address B" is specified as the delegated minter. 
2) Visit the "address A" dashboard-specific URL from "address B" to MINT FLUX.

**My "MINT" Button is greyed out with the following tooltip: "Select the Delegated Minter Address account in your wallet to mint for this address."**

AddressA = Started Mint

AddressB = Delegated Minter

- Make sure the URL is: **Followed by AddressA**
- Make sure AddressB is selected in Metamask
