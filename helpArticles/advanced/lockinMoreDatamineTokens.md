**Please note**: stopping your validator will cause you to lose your current time bonus. Any **unminted** FLUX tokens will also be lost. We recommend that you **mint** your FLUX tokens **before stopping your validator**.

Step 1.
To increase your validator size, you have to **stop your existing mint first**. This is done to prevent various exploits and to discourage accessing cold storage balance. 
You will find the STOP MINT button in your Dashboard Section: Address Balances.
