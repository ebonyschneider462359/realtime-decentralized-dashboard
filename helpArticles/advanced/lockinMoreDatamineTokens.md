**Please note**: unlocking your DAM tokens will cause you to lose your current time bonus. Any **unminted** FLUX tokens will also be lost. We recommend that you **mint** your FLUX tokens **before unlocking** DAM.

Step 1.
To add more DAM tokens to your locked balance, you have to **unlock DAM first**. This is done to prevent various exploits and to discourage accessing cold storage balance. 
You will find the UNLOCK DAM button in your Dashboard Section: Address Balances.
