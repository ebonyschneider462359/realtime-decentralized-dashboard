# Understanding MetaMask Gas Fees

This guide explains what gas fees are in MetaMask, why they are necessary for Datamine transactions, and how to manage them effectively. 

## Setting Your Gas Fee

Datamine's Ethereum-based smart contracts have actions such as: locking, minting, burning, all of which require GAS. We recommend setting your GAS Fee to **Fast** so that your transaction processes quickly.

You can access your MetaMask extension through your browser:

When you are ready to confirm your transaction, click the EDIT button under GAS FEE.
Select Fast (this will slightly increase your transaction fee but also result in a faster transaction).

## Transaction Status and Speed-Up

After pressing confirm, your transaction will now be PENDING. Confirmation may take anywhere from several seconds up to a few minutes.

You also have the ability to speed up your transaction by viewing the transaction details and adding some GAS. 
If you have pending transactions that you cannot speed up due to low gas fees, you need to wait for them to confirm.

## Troubleshooting Low Gas Fees

If your GAS fee was too low or the transaction data was corrupted, you will see the following message. We recommend refreshing your browser and then resubmitting your transaction.

Congratulations! You can now adjust your GAS fee in MetaMask and check the status of your transaction.
