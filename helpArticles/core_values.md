# Our Use Case: Transaction-incentivized Liquidity Pools
DAM and FLUX are dual interconnected tokens that offer unique incentives for providing liquidity on Uniswap & Balancer pools. Our core on-chain use case ensures constant movement of tokens through any liquidity pool.

Datamine (DAM) tokens have fixed supply to form high volatility pool. Over 70% of lifetime DAM supply is locked-up in the FLUX minting smart contract. Constant demand to lock-up more DAM creates on-chain velocity.

FLUX tokens have infinite supply and deflation is automatically adjusted by "controlled on-chain burn" to create low volatility pool. Over 60% of all FLUX tokens have been destroyed from circulation creating on-chain velocity where FLUX is used as a form of "fuel" for the controlled burn.

# On-Chain Linear Deflation
FLUX can only be generated by locking-in DAM tokens. FLUX is generated in a linear & predictable manner every 15 seconds. FLUX mint ratio scales linearly based on the amount of FLUX destroyed from circulation.

Uniswap and Balancer act as M0 money pools in our DeFi ecosystem. FLUX is constantly "re-cycled" through the liquidity pools via Burning & FLUX Minting cycles.
With no DAM inflation and controlled FLUX deflation our liquidity pools offer high transaction throughput.
