# How to Burn FLUX Tokens

This guide explains how to burn FLUX tokens to increase your burn multiplier, which can significantly boost your FLUX minting rate (up to 10x faster). The amount of FLUX required to achieve these multipliers is displayed on your dashboard.

Both minting and burning are smart contract actions that incur a small gas fee. If your wallet holds FLUX tokens, the "BURN FLUX" button will be active. When confirming your transaction in MetaMask, we recommend setting the gas fee to "Fast" for quicker processing.
