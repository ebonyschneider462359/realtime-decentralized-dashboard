# ðŸ”¥ How to Burn FLUX, ArbiFLUX & LOCK Tokens

This guide explains how to burn FLUX, ArbiFLUX, and LOCK tokens to increase your burn multiplier, which can significantly boost your minting rate (up to 10x faster). The amount of FLUX/ArbiFLUX/LOCK required to achieve these multipliers is displayed on your dashboard.

Both minting and burning are smart contract actions that incur a small gas fee. If your wallet holds FLUX, ArbiFLUX, or LOCK tokens, the "BURN" button will be active. When confirming your transaction in MetaMask, we recommend setting the gas fee to "Fast" for quicker processing.

## Burning LOCK Tokens

Burning LOCK tokens has a unique effect: it redirects value to the liquidity pool, strengthening the liquidity foundation rather than simply decreasing the token supply. This contributes to long-term stability and resilience of the ecosystem.
