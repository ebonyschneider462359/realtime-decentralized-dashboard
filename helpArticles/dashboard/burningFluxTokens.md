Burning FLUX increases burn mutliplier **at time of minting FLUX**. Your validator can receive up FLUX tokens up to 10x faster by burning 9x the global burned average. The number of FLUX required to burn to get to these multipliers is available on our dashboard.

Minting and burning are smart contract actions that incur a small gas fee. If your wallet contains FLUX tokens, you will see the "BURN FLUX" button. 

When confirming your transaction in MetaMask, we recommend setting the GAS FEE to "Fast" to ensure your transaction processes quickly.
