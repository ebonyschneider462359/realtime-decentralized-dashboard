# Authorizing Datamine Smart Contract

In order to lock in DAM, you need to authorize the Datamine smart contract to interact with your Ethereum wallet (which costs a small gas fee). This option will only be available after you have connected your MetaMask wallet to Datamine ecosystem

By pressing Enable, Datamine checks your DAM and ETH balances before allowing you to lock in DAM. Every transaction or smart contract in Ethereum requires gas. Locking in DAM is done via a smart contract. If you do not have Ethereum to pay a small gas fee, you will be unable to lock in any DAM. Therefore, we recommend that you have a starting balance of ~$10 in Ethereum.

# Locking-in Datamine (DAM) Tokens

## Step 1

You can now lock-in your DAM tokens by clicking the "Lock-In" button. After pay a small gas fee for locking-in your DAM tokens, you will start generating FLUX tokens in your dashboard (**with every single block ~ 15 seconds, you generate of 0.00000001 FLUX per 1 Locked DAM**)

## Step 2

To continue, enter how many DAM tokens you wish to lock. You can unlock these funds to get 100% of DAM tokens back at any time.

## Step 3

You can Mint FLUX to your MetaMask address OR you can mint to ANOTHER delegated minting address (e.g. your friend's wallet). Unless you want to Mint to another address, we recommend selecting "I want to mint my own FLUX tokens."

Please follow directions in MetaMask window to confirm the lock-in transaction. We recommend selecting GAS FEE to FAST to ensure your transactions process quickly. You can select Fast after pressing "EDIT" under Gas Fee.

Allow transaction to confirm.

Congratulations, your DAM is now locked. You are now generating FLUX tokens. You can unlock your DAM token balance at any time to get 100% of your DAM locked-in tokens back.

**Unlocking your DAM tokens will cause you to lose your current time bonus. Any unminted FLUX tokens will also be lost. We recommend that you mint your FLUX tokens before unlocking DAM.**
