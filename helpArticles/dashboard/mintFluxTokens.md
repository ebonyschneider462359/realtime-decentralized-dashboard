# ⛏️ How to Mint FLUX, ArbiFLUX & LOCK Tokens

This guide explains the process of minting FLUX, ArbiFLUX, and LOCK tokens from your Datamine (DAM) validator or by locking ArbiFLUX. To begin, you must have an active validator with your DAM tokens or ArbiFLUX to lock.

## Minting LOCK Tokens

LOCK tokens are minted by locking ArbiFLUX tokens on Arbitrum L2. This process contributes to the permanent liquidity pool and enhances the stability of the ecosystem. The mechanics of minting LOCK are similar to minting FLUX/ArbiFLUX, but instead of staking DAM, you are locking ArbiFLUX.

## Step 1: Understand FLUX/ArbiFLUX Generation and Unminted Balance
Once your validator is active, you will instantly begin generating FLUX/ArbiFLUX tokens. The generation rate is approximately **0.00000001 FLUX/ArbiFLUX per 1 DAM in validator** every 12 seconds with each new block. This means your token balance will automatically increase in real-time on your dashboard.

You will see a real-time "Unminted FLUX/ArbiFLUX USD Balance," which is an estimate of your tokens' value based on real, on-chain USD multi-route Uniswap data. While these tokens are unminted, they reside within the smart contract, not directly in your MetaMask account.

To receive your generated tokens from your validator, you need to click the "MINT" button.

For optimal efficiency, consider minting your tokens when:

1.  You have achieved the 3x time bonus (typically 28 days after starting a validator).
2.  Before minting, ensure you have the 10x burn multiplier. If not, consider acquiring and burning FLUX/ArbiFLUX to reach this bonus.

Remember, all bonuses are calculated at the time of minting tokens.

## Step 2: Specify Destination Address
To proceed, please specify an Ethereum-based address where you wish to receive these tokens. You can use any valid Ethereum address.

## Step 3: Confirm Transaction in MetaMask
Please follow the instructions in your MetaMask window to finalize your transaction. This action requires a small gas fee. We recommend setting the gas fee to "FAST" to ensure your transaction is processed quickly.
