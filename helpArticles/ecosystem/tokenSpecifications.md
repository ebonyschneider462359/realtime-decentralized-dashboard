To bootstrap the DAM/FLUX token ecosystem we chose to use a fair distribution of the two year old Bulwark blockchain. This was a Proof Of Stake/Masternode coin where users were familiar with lock-in mechanism making this community an ideal candidate for Datamine Ecosystem.

For the base **Datamine (DAM)** token we've kept it as simple and basic as possible. This token is a standard ERC-777 implementation and was deployed on Ethereum mainnet with fixed supply of 25,000,000 DAM. 16,876,778.9 DAM tokens were ultimately swapped and [8,123,221.10 DAM tokens were burned](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ad8bc825462730cadfc895d597f43483744c3aff5e57711d26c190956f93177) (destroyed from circulation). 

**FLUX** is a NON-FIXED supply token in our ecosystem. FLUX has linear and predictable inflation & controlled burn which forms the base currency of DeFi.

- **DAM lock/unlock:** To generate FLUX tokens you need to lock in some DAM. There is no minimum amount unlike staking/masternodes and the rewards scale linearly & predictably.
- **Delegate minting:** When you lock-in your DAM you can specify ANOTHER Ethereum address to mint on behalf of your address. This is a core security feature of Datamine Ecosystem.
- **Remote minting:** So you can mint FLUX from your phone to any Ethereum address, even though DAM is stored & locked-in on your hardware wallet (Such as Ledger Nano S).
- **Remote burning:** So you can burn your FLUX to any other address with locked-in Datamine (DAM) tokens.
- **Partial minting:** You can specify a percentage of minting (0-100%). This allows for minting of small amounts including partial minting to other addresses.
- **3x Time Bonus:** After you lock-in DAM for at least 24 hours, you will start receiving a small mint multiplier every 15 seconds. This lasts for 28 days after which you can gain a permanent 3x (until you unlock DAM) minting bonus to your FLUX mints.
- **10x Burn Bonus:** If you burn 9x the global average then you will get 10x the mint rate. This is a global number that is based on how much DAM is currently locked-in and how much FLUX these locked-in addresses burned. Keep in mind the formula is based on ratios, so by locking 10 DAM you would need 10x the burn amount compared to locking in 1 DAM. You can think of it this way: (**All the FLUX I've ever burned / my DAM locked-in) must be 9 times greater than (global burned FLUX of only users that are currently locked-in / global DAM locked-in**)

The minting bonuses are multiplicative. So you can get up to **30x FLUX minting rate**. It is suggested to get max 30x mint rate IF POSSIBLE at time of minting FLUX. 

**The most efficient way to mint at any time is:**

1. Get 3x time bonus (28 days after locking). 
2. Before pressing mint, make sure you burn as much FLUX as possible to get to max 10x burn bonus multiplier. Bonuses are calculated at the time of mint.
