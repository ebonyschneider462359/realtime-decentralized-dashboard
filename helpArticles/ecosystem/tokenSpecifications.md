To bootstrap the DAM/FLUX token ecosystem we chose to use a fair distribution of the two year old Bulwark blockchain. This was a Proof Of Stake/Masternode coin where users were familiar with "lock-in" mechanism of starting a mint making this community an ideal candidate for Datamine Ecosystem.

For the base **Datamine (DAM)** token we've kept it as simple and basic as possible. This token is a standard ERC-777 implementation and was deployed on Ethereum mainnet with fixed supply of 25,000,000 DAM. 16,876,778.9 DAM tokens were ultimately swapped and [8,123,221.10 DAM tokens were burned](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ad8bc825462730cadfc895d597f43483744c3aff5e57711d26c190956f93177) (destroyed from circulation). 

**FLUX** is a NON-FIXED supply token in our ecosystem. FLUX has linear and predictable inflation & controlled burn which forms the base currency of DeFi.

- **Mint Start/Stop:** To generate FLUX tokens you need to start a mint with some DAM. There is no minimum amount unlike staking/masternodes and the rewards scale linearly & predictably.
- **Delegate minting:** When you start your mint you can specify ANOTHER Ethereum address to mint on behalf of your address. This is a core security feature of Datamine Ecosystem.
- **Remote minting:** So you can mint FLUX from your phone to any Ethereum address, even though DAM is stored on your hardware wallet (Such as Ledger Nano S).
- **Remote burning:** So you can burn your FLUX to any other address with an active mint.
- **Partial minting:** You can specify a percentage of minting (0-100%). This allows for minting of small amounts including partial minting to other addresses.
- **3x Time Bonus:** After you leave a mint started for at least 24 hours, you will start receiving a small mint multiplier every 15 seconds. This lasts for 28 days after which you can gain a permanent 3x (until you stop your mint) minting bonus to your FLUX mints.
- **10x Burn Bonus**: If you burn 9x the global average of burned FLUX,  you will get 10x the mint rate. This is a global number that is based on how much DAM is currently powring mints and how much FLUX these addresses have burned. **In other words: (All the FLUX I've ever burned / my DAM mint size) must be 9 times greater than (global burned FLUX of active mints / DAM powering active mints).**

The minting bonuses are multiplicative. So you can get up to **30x FLUX minting rate**. It is suggested to get max 30x mint rate IF POSSIBLE at time of minting FLUX. 

**The most efficient way to mint at any time is:**

1. Get 3x time bonus (28 days after startming a mint). 
2. Before pressing mint, make sure you burn as much FLUX as possible to get to max 10x burn bonus multiplier. Bonuses are calculated at the time of mint.
