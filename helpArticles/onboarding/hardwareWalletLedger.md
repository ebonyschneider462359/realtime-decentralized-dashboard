After reading this guide, you will know how to securely store DAM tokens on your Ledger device. You must own a Ledger Hardware Wallet and have MetaMask installed before starting.

**Step 1**: Download the official Ledger Live application from: [www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download/](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download/)

4. You may now exit out of the Ethereum application. 

**Step 5**: Connecting Ledger to MetaMask.

Before starting, make sure that you have the most up-to-date firmware on your Ledger device (firmware version 1.6) and the most up-to-date Ethereum App on the Ledger (from Ledger Live > Manager). 

1. Close the Ledger Live application.
2. Leave your Ledger device connected to your computer.
3. Open your MetaMask wallet. Go to your accounts. Press "Connect Hardware Wallet"

7. You have now successfully imported your Ledger ETH (Hardware) address into your MetaMask wallet! You can safely store DAM on this Ethereum address.

**Please note**: you need to manually authorize withdrawals and approve any smart-contract actions directly from your Ledger Device (you will see the pending transaction awaiting your approval on the Ledger device). This is a security measure designed to prevent anyone from using your DAM balance if your MetaMask wallet is compromised.
