# Step 5

The next screen will give you two options

Import Wallet - this is when you already have a wallet on MetaMask, as this guide is for creating a new wallet, we will not be using this option.

Create a Wallet - this option will take you through the steps of creating a new Wallet on MetaMask.

![Metamask](../../helpArticles/assets/images/pngs/metamask/metamask6.png#_maxWidth=512)

Click on ‘Create a Wallet’.

# Step 6

After you click ‘Create a Wallet’ it will open up ‘Help Us Improve MetaMask’ page which includes the permissions of MetaMask and how it keeps your keys safe.

You can click on "No Thanks"or "I agree" and proceed to the next step.

# Step 7

The next step is to create a strong password for your MetaMask wallet. This is the password that you will use to sign into MetaMask everyday from your browser and also sign transactions. Therefore, please make sure that you have a strong password that cannot get compromised.

# Step 8

Once you have setup a strong password, the next step is to note down your Seed Keywords. A combination of the seed keywords or ‘Secret Backup Phrase’ along with your ‘Password’ is the key to your MetaMask account.

Once you’ve written down the seed keywords, click on ‘Next’ button to proceed to the net step. On the next screen after this, MetaMask will confirm that you have stored the ‘Secret Backup Phrase’ safely.

# Step 9

Read the tips on the next page and click ‘All done’.

# How to receive ETH, DAM & FLUX

![Metamask](../../helpArticles/assets/images/pngs/metamask/metamask13.png#_maxWidth=512)

Click on ‘Deposit’ on the first screen of your wallet, then View Account. When you click ‘View Account' you will see your personal Ethereum address. Copy the address starting with 0x……this is the address you will use to receive Ethereum, DAM, or FLUX.

When confirming transactions, we recommend setting your GAS FEE to "Fast" to ensure your transactions process quickly.
