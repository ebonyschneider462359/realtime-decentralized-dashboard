Before attempting to swap DAM or earning trading fees by becoming a liquidity provider, let's take a step back and check out the DAM page on Uniswap. 

**Start by going to**: [info.uniswap.org](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x447f8d287120b66f39856ae5ceb01512a7a47444)

Here, you will see the exchange home page that contains total liquidity and 24 hour trading volume. Pretty neat. Remember, Uniswap is decentralized. This means peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies with NO central authority.
